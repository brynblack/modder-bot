# modder-bot
A discord.py bot that I am working on currently.

The intended use of this bot is for moderation, and administrator related actions.

At the moment, this bot features ban, unban, and kick logging in an easy-to-read embed format, and also is getting moderation commands in the near future, such as ban, kick, etc.
